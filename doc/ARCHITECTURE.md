# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The All Fintech SDK follows a clean, modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use. The SDK implements a dual-service pattern where each provider offers both data-only operations and UI-enabled components.

## Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Data Layer**: Pure business logic and API interactions
- **UI Layer**: Flutter widgets and user interface components
- **Core Layer**: Shared utilities, configurations, and abstractions

### 2. Provider Pattern
Each fintech provider is implemented as a self-contained module with:
- Data service for API operations
- UI service for widget components
- Models for type-safe data structures
- Client for HTTP communication

### 3. Dependency Injection
The SDK uses constructor injection for better testability and flexibility.

│   └── services/             # Shared services
└── all_fintech_flutter_sdk.dart  # Public API
```

## Provider Architecture

Each provider follows this structure:

```
providers/[provider_name]/
├── data/
│   └── [provider]_data_service.dart
├── ui/
│   ├── widgets/
│   └── [provider]_ui_service.dart
├── models/
│   └── [provider]_models.dart
├── [provider]_client.dart
└── [provider]_provider.dart
```

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: SDK is configured with provider-specific credentials
2. **Provider Selection**: User selects appropriate provider
3. **Operation Execution**: 
   - Data operations go through the data service
   - UI operations show widgets and handle user interaction
4. **Response Handling**: Results are returned as typed models

## Error Handling

The SDK implements comprehensive error handling:
- Custom exception hierarchy
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Offline support with request queuing
- Webhook signature verification

## Security

- OAuth 2.0 for supported providers
- Request signing and verification
- Secure credential storage
- Webhook payload validation

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Mock implementations for testing
